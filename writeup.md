## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

Git is a VCS, a tool for tracking changes to code, while GitHub is an interface used to interact with the functions of Git. Github is the way we use Git.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Commiting is when you make changes to a project and want to add a checkpoint and communicate why this change was made. Pushing adds all commits to the repository. Commiting is like placing changes in a queue, while pusching is finalizing these items.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository is a sort of project folder that contains all of the history and files in a project. It can be used for a school assignment or as a profile for your GitHub account and much more.
